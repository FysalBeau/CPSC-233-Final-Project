Project Goal
--------------------------
We want to make a game similar to pokemon. The base idea of this game is that the player starts off with nothing, gaining strength and working their way up to a “final boss”. The player collects items, aswell as captures enemies to aid them in their quest which is ultimately to complete the game by defeating the final boss. 
--------------------------

File List 
--------------------------
1.Main.java
2.Map.java
3.Capture.java

How to set up the program 
--------------------------
Step 1: Create a new folder in your directory and set put all three files mentioned above in that folder.
Step 2: Open terminal and type cd<<space>>foldername to get to the desired folder
Step 3: Type javac -cp .:hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:jar:junit-4.12.jar *.java to compile all files ending with .java
Step 4: Type java Main to run the program. 
Step 5: Enjoy!
